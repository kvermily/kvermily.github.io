# Austentatious
A website designed to introduce readers to works inspired, influenced, or invoking Jane Austen's classic novels.

## History
Austentatious was designed as a project for ENG 654 (Fall 2022). Based on the physical concept of blind date with a book featured at bookstores and libraries, this digital adaptation pairs Jane Austen novels with texts inspired, influenced, or invoking themes featured within Jane Austen's novels.

## Limitations
### 1:1 Relationship
The current version of the website uses a Javascript GET command with a 1:1 relationship between Austen novel and book recommendation.

Future enhancements would be to set up a 1:many relationship so that when an Austen novel is selected, user is routed to book from those tagged by that Austen novel. This will also allow the "Find Me Another" button featured on each book recommendation page to perform this function vs. the current redirect back to index.html.
